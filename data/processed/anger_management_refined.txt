Autism and Anger Management – A Guide for Parents and Carers     

Communicate Clearly   

• Autistic people may experience frustration and anger due to difficulties in  communication and sensory differences.  
 
• Speak clearly and precisely using short sentences.  
 
• Use visual communication tools  to help express wants, needs, or physical discomfort  (e.g., visual stress scales, PECS, body part symbols, pain charts/apps).  
 
• Apply the "six-second rule" : give the information, wait six seconds to allow processing,  then repeat if needed using the same words.     

Provide Structure  
 
• Establishing structure reduces anxiety and helps manage anger:   

o Use visual timetables  and supports.   

o Include relaxing activities  in daily routines.   

o Allow time alone  to recharge.     

Help Identify Emotions  
 
• Emotions can be difficult to understand; use visual aids like:   

o Traffic light systems   

o Thermometer scales   

o Number scales (1 –5) 
 
• Teach the meaning of “angry” by referring to physical signs  (e.g., red face, tummy ache).  
 
• Once calm/angry extremes are understood, teach the in -between emotions.     

Use Social Stories or Digital Tools  
 
• Social stories help children understand and manage anger.  
 
• Adults can use tools like Brain in Hand  for self-management.     

Offer a Safe Space or Time Out  
 
• Provide a calm space to regulate emotions —could be:   

o A bedroom  or quiet area   

o A calming activity     

Offer an Alternative  
 
• Redirect anger into a physical outlet  such as:   

o Punching a punchbag   

o Jumping on a trampoline   

o Running in the garden     

Watch for Bullying  
 
• Autistic people are at increased risk of being bullied and may not recognize or describe  it. 
 
• Bullying can lead to anger or distressed behavior —monitor and support as needed.
