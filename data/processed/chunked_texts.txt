Getting and Keeping Their Attention   
---
Our quick tips may help you to communicate more effectively with an autistic person, whether  it’s your child, pupil, colleague, or friend.

Processing Information   
---
An autistic person can find it difficult to filter out the less important information. If there is too  much information, it can lead to ‘overload’ , where no further information can be processed. To  help:   
• Always use their name at the beginning so that they know you are talking to them.  
 
• Make sure they are paying attention before you ask a question or give an instruction. The  signs that someone is paying attention will be different for different people.  
 
• Use their hobbies and interests, or the activity they are currently doing, to engage them.  
 
• Say less and say it slowly.  
 
• Use specific key words, repeating and stressing them.

Avoiding Open -Ended Questions   
---
Some autistic people find open -ended questions difficult to process. It may help to:  
 
• Keep questions short.  
 
• Ask only the most necessary questions.  
 
• Structure your questions, e.g., you could offer options or choices.  
 
• Be specific. For example, ask “Did you enjoy your lunch?”  and “Did you enjoy maths?”   rather than “How was your day?” .

Ways to Ask for Help   
---
If appropriate, give autistic people a visual help card  to use to ask for help.     
---
Being Clear  
 
• Avoid using irony, sarcasm, figurative language, rhetorical questions, idioms, or  exaggeration , as autistic people can take these literally. If you do use these, explain  what you have said and be clear about what you really mean to say.

Supporting Distressed Behaviour  
 
• Pause between words and phrases to give the person time to process what you’ve said,  and to give them a chance to think of a response.  
 
• Don’t use too many questions.  
 
• Use less non -verbal communication  (e.g., eye contact, facial expressions, gestures,  body language).  
 
• Use visual supports  (e.g., symbols, timetables, Social Stories) if appropriate.  
 
• Be aware of the environment  (noisy/crowded) that you are in. Sensory differences may  be affecting how much someone can process.

Reactions to “No”

Next Steps  
 
• Offer other ways of expressing ‘no’ or ‘stop.’  
 
• Try using a different word or symbol.  
 
• Autistic people may be confused about why you said no. If it’s an activity that they can  do later on that day or week, try showing this in a timetable.  
 
• ‘No’ is often used when someone is putting themselves or others in danger. If it’s a  safety issue, look at ways of explaining danger and safety.  
 
• If you are saying ‘no’ because someone is behaving inappropriately, you may want to  change your reaction  to their behaviour. Try not to shout or give too much attention —a  calm reaction may help to decrease this behaviour in time.  
 
• Set clear boundaries  and explain why and where it is acceptable and not acceptable to  behave in certain ways.

Behaviour Tracking  
 
• Use a behaviour diary  to work out if the behaviour is a way of telling you something.
