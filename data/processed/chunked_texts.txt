Communication Tips

Getting and Keeping Their Attention   
---
Our quick tips may help you to communicate more effectively with an autistic person, whether  it’s your child, pupil, colleague, or friend.   
---
Processing Information   
---
An autistic person can find it difficult to filter out the less important information. If there is too  much information, it can lead to ‘overload’ , where no further information can be processed. To  help:   
• Always use their name at the beginning so that they know you are talking to them.  
 
• Make sure they are paying attention before you ask a question or give an instruction. The  signs that someone is paying attention will be different for different people.  
 
• Use their hobbies and interests, or the activity they are currently doing, to engage them.  
 
• Say less and say it slowly.  
 
• Use specific key words, repeating and stressing them.

Avoiding Open -Ended Questions   
---
Some autistic people find open -ended questions difficult to process. It may help to:  
 
• Keep questions short.  
 
• Ask only the most necessary questions.  
 
• Structure your questions, e.g., you could offer options or choices.  
 
• Be specific. For example, ask “Did you enjoy your lunch?”  and “Did you enjoy maths?”   rather than “How was your day?” .

Ways to Ask for Help   
---
If appropriate, give autistic people a visual help card  to use to ask for help.     
---
Being Clear  
 
• Avoid using irony, sarcasm, figurative language, rhetorical questions, idioms, or  exaggeration , as autistic people can take these literally. If you do use these, explain  what you have said and be clear about what you really mean to say.     
---
Supporting Distressed Behaviour  
 
• Pause between words and phrases to give the person time to process what you’ve said,  and to give them a chance to think of a response.  
 
• Don’t use too many questions.  
 
• Use less non -verbal communication  (e.g., eye contact, facial expressions, gestures,  body language).  
 
• Use visual supports  (e.g., symbols, timetables, Social Stories) if appropriate.  
 
• Be aware of the environment  (noisy/crowded) that you are in. Sensory differences may  be affecting how much someone can process.

Reactions to “No”   
---
Next Steps  
 
• Offer other ways of expressing ‘no’ or ‘stop.’  
 
• Try using a different word or symbol.  
 
• Autistic people may be confused about why you said no. If it’s an activity that they can  do later on that day or week, try showing this in a timetable.  
 
• ‘No’ is often used when someone is putting themselves or others in danger. If it’s a  safety issue, look at ways of explaining danger and safety.  
 
• If you are saying ‘no’ because someone is behaving inappropriately, you may want to  change your reaction  to their behaviour. Try not to shout or give too much attention —a  calm reaction may help to decrease this behaviour in time.  
 
• Set clear boundaries  and explain why and where it is acceptable and not acceptable to  behave in certain ways.     
---
Behaviour Tracking  
 
• Use a behaviour diary  to work out if the behaviour is a way of telling you something.

Uses of Visual Supports   
---
Visual supports can be used in different ways, such as:  
 
• Single message : The person takes a yellow card when they need to go to the toilet or  places a purple card on a board when feeling stressed.  
 
• Daily schedule : Visual timetables, reward charts, and structured routines help provide  predictability.  
 
• Making choices : The person selects a visual option, such as placing the trampolining  symbol in the "afternoon" slot on the board.  
 
• Illustrating a story : Used in social stories and comic strip conversations.  
 
• Expressing opinions : Using a thumbs -up/down symbol to indicate enjoyment of an  activity.   
---
Examples of Visual Supports  
 
• Choice boards  
 
• Different colored tablecloths (e.g., white for dinner time, blue for coloring time)  
 
• Emotion thermometers  
 
• First-then sequences  
 
• Key phrase symbols (e.g., "I want," "What’s that?")  
 
• Labels for objects and storage  
 
• Morning schedules  
 
• Photos and maps for explanations (e.g., "Mom is at work," "My new school is in  Glasgow")  
 
• Safety signs  
 
• Visual scripts for social situations  
 
• Task sequence instruction strips (e.g., for using the bathroom)  
 
• Time trackers for transitions between activities

Top Tips for Using Visual Supports  
 
• Portable : Use apps, store images on a phone, or carry laminated symbols in a folder.  
 
• Durable: Laminate printed materials and back up digital files.  
 
• Easy to find : Place symbols in visible locations, attach to objects, or keep them in a  designated folder.  
 
• Personalized : Adapt to individual preferences (e.g., using a space -themed visual  timetable for a child interested in rockets).  
 
• Consistent : Use the same type of symbols (e.g., line drawings vs. photographs) across  different settings and ensure caregivers use them consistently.

Language Development in Autistic Children   
---
Key Points   
---
• Autistic children might need support to develop language skills.  
 
• Providing opportunities to use language can enhance their development.  
 
• Playing, modeling language, and responding positively to language can improve  communication.   
---
How Autistic Children Develop Language  
 
• Children develop language through relationships and play.  
 
• Autistic children may struggle with language development because they focus on  details in their environment, missing key language -learning opportunities.  
 
• For example, a baby distracted by a ceiling fan may not engage in social interactions  necessary for language learning.   
---
Creating Opportunities for Language Use  
 
• Autistic children need regular, meaningful, and motivating  opportunities to use  language.  
 
• Strategies to encourage language use:   o Place their favorite toy out of reach so they need to ask for it.   o Take turns during activities (e.g., opening picture books, playing with puzzles).   o Pause and give them time to express thoughts or feelings.   
---
Progressing Language Skills  
 
• Gradually increase language complexity:   o Start with single -word responses (e.g., "Ball").   o Move to short phrases (e.g., "Push the ball").   o Introduce social greetings (e.g., waving, saying "Hi").   o Transfer these skills to different people and settings.   
---
Using Play to Support Language Development  
 
• Play helps children learn language in a natural way.  
 
• Examples:   o If doing a jigsaw puzzle, only hand them a piece when they ask for it.   o Engage in pretend play where they communicate needs or make requests.   
---
Modeling Language for Autistic Children  
 
• Modeling  involves demonstrating how to use language with words, facial expressions,  and gestures.  
 
• Strategies:   o Comment on actions: Say "Open" while opening a door.   o Label experiences: Say "Stuck" when they struggle with a zipper.   o Provide words they may need: Say "Help" when they try to open a packet.   
---
Encouraging Speech & Language Growth  
 
• Follow the child's interests : Engage in conversations about topics they enjoy.  
 
• Adapt communication : If they use 1 -word phrases, model 2-3 word sentences to  expand their language skills.  
 
• Respond positively : Reward communication efforts by giving them what they request or  by smiling and engaging.   
---
When to Seek Professional Help  
 
• If concerned about a child’s language development, consult:   o Child and family health nurses   o General practitioners (GPs)   o Pediatricians   o Speech pathologists   
---
Alternative Communication Methods  
 
• Some autistic children use gestures, Key Word Sign, PECS (Picture Exchange  Communication System), or other augmentative communication methods. 
 
• You can support language development by building on their preferred communication  style.   o Example: If a child pulls your hand toward an object, model how they can use  words to ask for it.
