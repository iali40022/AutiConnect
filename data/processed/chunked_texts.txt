Communication Tips 
---
Getting and Keeping Their Attention   
---
Our quick tips may help you to communicate more effectively with an autistic person, whether  it’s your child, pupil, colleague, or friend.   
---
Processing Information   
---
An autistic person can find it difficult to filter out the less important information. If there is too  much information, it can lead to ‘overload’ , where no further information can be processed. To  help:   
• Always use their name at the beginning so that they know you are talking to them.  
 
• Make sure they are paying attention before you ask a question or give an instruction. The  signs that someone is paying attention will be different for different people.  
 
• Use their hobbies and interests, or the activity they are currently doing, to engage them.  
 
• Say less and say it slowly.  
 
• Use specific key words, repeating and stressing them.     
---
Avoiding Open -Ended Questions   
---
Some autistic people find open -ended questions difficult to process. It may help to:  
 
• Keep questions short.  
 
• Ask only the most necessary questions.  
 
• Structure your questions, e.g., you could offer options or choices.  
 
• Be specific. For example, ask “Did you enjoy your lunch?”  and “Did you enjoy maths?”   rather than “How was your day?” .    
---
Ways to Ask for Help   
---
If appropriate, give autistic people a visual help card  to use to ask for help.     
---
Being Clear  
 
• Avoid using irony, sarcasm, figurative language, rhetorical questions, idioms, or  exaggeration , as autistic people can take these literally. If you do use these, explain  what you have said and be clear about what you really mean to say.     
---
Supporting Distressed Behaviour  
 
• Pause between words and phrases to give the person time to process what you’ve said,  and to give them a chance to think of a response.  
 
• Don’t use too many questions.  
 
• Use less non -verbal communication  (e.g., eye contact, facial expressions, gestures,  body language).  
 
• Use visual supports  (e.g., symbols, timetables, Social Stories) if appropriate.  
 
• Be aware of the environment  (noisy/crowded) that you are in. Sensory differences may  be affecting how much someone can process.     
---
Reactions to “No”   
---
Next Steps  
 
• Offer other ways of expressing ‘no’ or ‘stop.’  
 
• Try using a different word or symbol.  
 
• Autistic people may be confused about why you said no. If it’s an activity that they can  do later on that day or week, try showing this in a timetable.  
 
• ‘No’ is often used when someone is putting themselves or others in danger. If it’s a  safety issue, look at ways of explaining danger and safety.  
 
• If you are saying ‘no’ because someone is behaving inappropriately, you may want to  change your reaction  to their behaviour. Try not to shout or give too much attention —a  calm reaction may help to decrease this behaviour in time.  
 
• Set clear boundaries  and explain why and where it is acceptable and not acceptable to  behave in certain ways.     
---
Behaviour Tracking  
 
• Use a behaviour diary  to work out if the behaviour is a way of telling you something.
---
Visual Supports   
---
Types of Visual Support 
---
Visual supports are a communication tool that can be used with autistic people. They can be used in most situations, are adaptable, and portable. 
---
Visual supports can help to:   
• Provide structure and routine  
 
• Encourage independence  
 
• Build confidence  
 
• Improve understanding  
 
• Avoid frustration and anxiety  
 
• Provide opportunities to interact with others   
---
A wide range of items can be used as visual supports, including:  
 
• Real objects, printed images, or digital tools (smartphones, tablets, computers)  
 
• Tactile symbols (e.g., swimming trunks, packaging, food labels)  
 
• Photographs  
 
• Short videos  
 
• Miniatures of real objects  
 
• Colored pictures  
 
• Plain squares of colored card  
 
• Line drawings  
 
• Symbols  
 
• Written words   
---
Uses of Visual Supports   
---
Visual supports can be used in different ways, such as:  
 
• Single message : The person takes a yellow card when they need to go to the toilet or  places a purple card on a board when feeling stressed.  
 
• Daily schedule : Visual timetables, reward charts, and structured routines help provide  predictability.  
 
• Making choices : The person selects a visual option, such as placing the trampolining  symbol in the "afternoon" slot on the board.  
 
• Illustrating a story : Used in social stories and comic strip conversations.  
 
• Expressing opinions : Using a thumbs -up/down symbol to indicate enjoyment of an  activity.   
---
Examples of Visual Supports  
 
• Choice boards  
 
• Different colored tablecloths (e.g., white for dinner time, blue for coloring time)  
 
• Emotion thermometers  
 
• First-then sequences  
 
• Key phrase symbols (e.g., "I want," "What’s that?")  
 
• Labels for objects and storage  
 
• Morning schedules  
 
• Photos and maps for explanations (e.g., "Mom is at work," "My new school is in  Glasgow")  
 
• Safety signs  
 
• Visual scripts for social situations  
 
• Task sequence instruction strips (e.g., for using the bathroom)  
 
• Time trackers for transitions between activities   
---
Top Tips for Using Visual Supports  
 
• Portable : Use apps, store images on a phone, or carry laminated symbols in a folder.  
 
• Durable: Laminate printed materials and back up digital files.  
 
• Easy to find : Place symbols in visible locations, attach to objects, or keep them in a  designated folder.  
 
• Personalized : Adapt to individual preferences (e.g., using a space -themed visual  timetable for a child interested in rockets).  
 
• Consistent : Use the same type of symbols (e.g., line drawings vs. photographs) across  different settings and ensure caregivers use them consistently.

Language Development in Autistic Children   
---
Key Points   
---
• Autistic children might need support to develop language skills.  
 
• Providing opportunities to use language can enhance their development.  
 
• Playing, modeling language, and responding positively to language can improve  communication.   
---
How Autistic Children Develop Language  
 
• Children develop language through relationships and play.  
 
• Autistic children may struggle with language development because they focus on  details in their environment, missing key language -learning opportunities.  
 
• For example, a baby distracted by a ceiling fan may not engage in social interactions  necessary for language learning.   
---
Creating Opportunities for Language Use  
 
• Autistic children need regular, meaningful, and motivating  opportunities to use  language.  
 
• Strategies to encourage language use:   o Place their favorite toy out of reach so they need to ask for it.   o Take turns during activities (e.g., opening picture books, playing with puzzles).   o Pause and give them time to express thoughts or feelings.   
---
Progressing Language Skills  
 
• Gradually increase language complexity:   o Start with single -word responses (e.g., "Ball").   o Move to short phrases (e.g., "Push the ball").   o Introduce social greetings (e.g., waving, saying "Hi").   o Transfer these skills to different people and settings.   
---
Using Play to Support Language Development  
 
• Play helps children learn language in a natural way.  
 
• Examples:   o If doing a jigsaw puzzle, only hand them a piece when they ask for it.   o Engage in pretend play where they communicate needs or make requests.   
---
Modeling Language for Autistic Children  
 
• Modeling  involves demonstrating how to use language with words, facial expressions,  and gestures.  
 
• Strategies:   o Comment on actions: Say "Open" while opening a door.   o Label experiences: Say "Stuck" when they struggle with a zipper.   o Provide words they may need: Say "Help" when they try to open a packet.   
---
Encouraging Speech & Language Growth  
 
• Follow the child's interests : Engage in conversations about topics they enjoy.  
 
• Adapt communication : If they use 1 -word phrases, model 2-3 word sentences to  expand their language skills.  
 
• Respond positively : Reward communication efforts by giving them what they request or  by smiling and engaging.   
---
When to Seek Professional Help  
 
• If concerned about a child’s language development, consult:   o Child and family health nurses   o General practitioners (GPs)   o Pediatricians   o Speech pathologists   
---
Alternative Communication Methods  
 
• Some autistic children use gestures, Key Word Sign, PECS (Picture Exchange  Communication System), or other augmentative communication methods. 
 
• You can support language development by building on their preferred communication  style.   o Example: If a child pulls your hand toward an object, model how they can use  words to ask for it.
---
Understanding Autistic Communication   
---
• Autistic people may have difficulties with both verbal and non -verbal communication.  
 
• They might not respond to their name, use echolalia (repeating words/phrases), or  communicate through behaviours instead of words.     
---
Stages of Communication (Hanen Programme)   
---
1. Own Agenda  – Prefers playing alone, communication is mostly unintentional.   
---
2. Requester  – Begins to understand that actions can influence others; may pull adults to  items.   
---
3. Early Communicator  – Engages in more two -way interaction using gestures, sounds, or  echolalia.   
---
4. Partner – Uses speech to communicate and engage in conversation but may find  unfamiliar environments challenging.     
---
Strategies to Support Communication   
---
Follow Their Lead  
 
• Let the child guide the interaction. 
---
Join their activity rather than directing it.   
---
Use Early Interaction Techniques  
 
• Use single words  for children at earlier communication stages (e.g., say “car” while  handing them a toy car).  
 
• Use expansions  to build on their communication, like turning “car” into “red car”.   
---
Build Communication Opportunities  
 
• Avoid anticipating all their needs.  
 
• Wait and encourage them to signal or ask for help. Offer support only after giving them  the chance to initiate.   
---
Be Face-to-Face  
 
• Position yourself at the child’s level to share eye contact and focus.   
---
Imitate  
 
• Copy their actions (e.g., spinning, clapping) to build a connection and promote  interaction.   
---
Use Gestures and Visual Aids  
 
• Demonstrate actions when speaking.  
 
• Use objects, photographs, cue cards, and visual timetables to reinforce meaning.   
---
Use Songs and Roleplay  
 
• Sing familiar songs and pause at predictable points to encourage participation.  
 
• Roleplay common scenarios using toys to build understanding and vocabulary.   
---
Give Feedback  
 
• Praise efforts to communicate and add comments to show you understand and  encourage further interaction.     
---
Creating Reasons to Communicate  
 
• Place favourite items slightly out of reach to motivate requests.  
 
• Use containers that require assistance to open.  
 
• Include unexpected situations (e.g., giving an empty cup) to prompt clarification.  
 
• Respect when the child ends an activity, even if it’s not verbally expressed.     
---
Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)   
---
AAC includes methods to support or replace spoken language.  
 
• Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS)  
 
• Sign Language  (e.g., Makaton, BSL)  
 
• Communication books or cue cards  
 
• Voice output devices  (e.g., BIGmack buttons)   
---
Note: Facilitated Communication is not recommended  due to lack of scientific evidence and  the risk of misleading input.     
---
Communication in Educational Settings  
 
• Children may struggle more to communicate in school due to anxiety, sensory issues, or  social stress.  
 
• Provide structure, patience, and repeated opportunities to practice communication.  
 
• Understand that speaking fluently does not always mean a child fully understands  instructions.

Teaching Nonverbal Autistic Children to Talk   
---
Adapted from Autism Speaks article by Geri Dawson and Lauren Elder
---
Research shows that even after age 4, many nonverbal autistic children can develop language.  
Below are seven effective, research-based strategies to support language development in  nonverbal autistic children and adolescents:     
---
1. Encourage Play and Social Interaction   
---
• Language learning happens through play.  
 
• Try different games, songs, rhymes, and gentle roughhousing.  
 
• Position yourself at your child’s eye level to improve interaction.     
---
2. Imitate Your Child  
 
• Mimic your child’s sounds and play behaviors.  
 
• This builds turn -taking and encourages vocalization.  
 
• Only imitate positive behaviors.     
---
3. Focus on Nonverbal Communication  
 
• Use gestures and eye contact.  
 
• Model exaggerated gestures (e.g., pointing, nodding).  
 
• Respond to your child’s gestures and give meaning to them.     
---
4. Leave “Space” for Your Child to Communicate  
 
• Don’t rush to speak for your child.  
 
• Pause after questions and wait expectantly.  
 
• Respond immediately to any sounds or movements.     
---
5. Simplify Your Language  
 
• Use words or phrases slightly more complex than your child’s current level.  
 
• For nonverbal children, use single words (e.g., “ball”).  
 
• If they use single words, speak in short phrases (e.g., “roll ball”).     
---
6. Follow Your Child’s Interests  
 
• Observe what your child is focused on and talk about it.  
 
• Narrate their actions using simple language.  
 
• Example: “shape,” “in,” or “dump shapes” during a shape sorter activity.     
---
7. Use Assistive Devices and Visual Supports  
 
• Tools like picture -based devices or apps can encourage communication.  
 
• Picture boards or cards can help children express needs and thoughts.  
 
• These supports can complement and even stimulate speech development.     
---
Note: Your child’s therapist can help you select the best combination of these strategies. Keep  them informed about what works and any challenges you face.

Autism and Anger Management – A Guide for Parents and Carers     
---
Communicate Clearly   
---
• Autistic people may experience frustration and anger due to difficulties in  communication and sensory differences.  
 
• Speak clearly and precisely using short sentences.  
 
• Use visual communication tools  to help express wants, needs, or physical discomfort  (e.g., visual stress scales, PECS, body part symbols, pain charts/apps).  
 
• Apply the "six-second rule" : give the information, wait six seconds to allow processing,  then repeat if needed using the same words.     
---
Provide Structure  
 
• Establishing structure reduces anxiety and helps manage anger:   
---
o Use visual timetables  and supports.   
---
o Include relaxing activities  in daily routines.   
---
o Allow time alone  to recharge.     
---
Help Identify Emotions  
 
• Emotions can be difficult to understand; use visual aids like:   
---
o Traffic light systems   
---
o Thermometer scales   
---
o Number scales (1 –5) 
 
• Teach the meaning of “angry” by referring to physical signs  (e.g., red face, tummy ache).  
 
• Once calm/angry extremes are understood, teach the in -between emotions.     
---
Use Social Stories or Digital Tools  
 
• Social stories help children understand and manage anger.  
 
• Adults can use tools like Brain in Hand  for self-management.     
---
Offer a Safe Space or Time Out  
 
• Provide a calm space to regulate emotions —could be:   
---
o A bedroom  or quiet area   
---
o A calming activity     
---
Offer an Alternative  
 
• Redirect anger into a physical outlet  such as:   
---
o Punching a punchbag   
---
o Jumping on a trampoline   
---
o Running in the garden     
---
Watch for Bullying  
 
• Autistic people are at increased risk of being bullied and may not recognize or describe  it. 
 
• Bullying can lead to anger or distressed behavior —monitor and support as needed.

Dealing with Change: Key Strategies for Autistic Individuals   
---
Routines and Difficulties with Change   
---
Autistic people can find any kind of change difficult, whether it’s small day -to-day  transitions or major life events. Set routines, rituals, and predictability can help manage  anxiety and create a sense of safety. For example:   
---
• Always travelling the same route to school or work  
 
• Eating the same food for breakfast  
 
• Having precise rituals around daily activities   
---
Rules and routines  can become especially rigid during periods of stress, illness, or major  change. Even minor transitions , such as moving between two activities, can cause  distress.   
---
Common Signs Related to Routine Dependence  
 
• Distress with changes to the environment, people, or schedules  
 
• Strong preferences for specific items (e.g., clothing fabric, soap brand)  
 
• Verbal rituals (repeated questioning with specific expected answers)  
 
• Compulsive behaviours (e.g., frequent handwashing or checking locks)   
---
Note: Compulsive behaviours do not always indicate OCD, but if concerned, consult a GP.     
---
Strategies to Support with Change   
---
1. Find Out About the Change   
---
Be proactive as a parent or carer. If a change is upcoming (e.g., a teacher leaving school),  try to get as much detail as possible in advance so the autistic individual can prepare.   
---
2. Describe the Change Clearly  
 
• Mark the date of the change on a calendar and help count down the days  
 
• Use clear, simple language  
 
• Limit gestures and facial expressions while explaining   
---
3. Use Visual Supports   
---
Visual aids can improve understanding and reduce anxiety:  
 
• Show photos of the new place , new people , or new activities  
 
• Create a photo book or folder to look at before and during the change  
 
• If going on holiday, show pictures of the entire journey , not just the airplane   
---
On the day of the change:  
 
• Use a visual timetable  to show what’s happening and when  
 
• Reverse the visuals to help explain the return journey   
---
4. Involve the Right People   
---
If moving to a new school or care provider:  
 
• Involve staff from both the current and new settings  
 
• Ensure person-centred planning  
 
• Focus on the individual’s needs, communication preferences, and potential anxiety  triggers   
---
5. Support Transitions Between Activities   
---
Sequencing and understanding time can be difficult. Strategies include:  
 
• Use a visual “now -and-next” board  
 
• Use a timer to show when an activity will end  
 
• Allow the person to move symbols or objects  to indicate an activity is finished  
 
• Make wait times as short and predictable as possible  
 
• Use visual representations of waiting time  (timers, sticker clocks)  
 
• Introduce transition boxes  with calming activities   
---
6. Manage Anxiety  
 
• Be observant of anxiety signs  
 
• Offer a worry book  or worry box  to express concerns  
 
• Explain positive aspects  of the change  
 
• Use social stories  or apps like “Brain in Hand” for support

Self-Injurious Behaviour – A Guide for All Audiences   
---
What is Self -Injurious Behaviour?   
---
Self-injurious behaviour refers to physically harming oneself, also called self-harm.  
Examples include:   
• Head banging  
 
• Hand or arm biting  
 
• Hair pulling  
 
• Eye gouging  
 
• Face or head slapping  
 
• Skin picking, scratching, or pinching  
 
• Forceful head shaking   
---
About half of autistic people experience self-injurious behaviour at some point.     
---
Causes of Self -Injurious Behaviour   
---
Communication difficulties:  
 
• The person may use self -injury to express frustration, seek desired  objects/activities, or avoid tasks.  
 
• Examples: head slapping to express pain, hand biting for anxiety, skin picking due to boredom.   
---
Mental health issues:  
 
• May indicate depression or anxiety.   
---
Repetitive behaviours:  
 
• Could stem from obsession or routine.   
---
Developmental stage -related:  
 
• Behaviours such as hand mouthing may persist.   
---
Learned behaviours:  
 
• Self-injury may become a learned way to control the environment or avoid unwanted situations.     
---
What to Do During an Episode  
 
• Respond quickly and consistently , never ignore severe behaviour.  
 
• Keep responses low-key: calm voice, limited facial expressions.  
 
• Reduce demands : postpone difficult tasks.  
 
• Remove physical/sensory discomforts : adjust clothing, noise levels, lighting, etc.  
 
• Redirect : use clear verbal instructions and visual cues. Offer alternative activities.  
 
• Light physical guidance : gently redirect hands, but use caution to avoid escalation.  
 
• Use barriers : e.g. pillows for head banging, alternative objects for biting.  
 
• Physical restraints  (only under specialist guidance): helmets, gloves, etc. Must be  temporary and combined with skill development.     
---
Preventing Self -Injurious Behaviour  
 
• Seek medical or dental advice : rule out physical causes.  
 
• Use a behaviour diary : track events before/during/after episodes to find patterns.  
 
• Increase structure and routine : create predictable daily plans.  
 
• Provide sensory alternatives : e.g. trampolines, chewable objects.  
 
• Use communication tools : e.g. visual symbols, body part pictures.  
 
• Reward appropriate behaviour : use praise, activities, or tokens immediately after  positive behaviour.  
 
• Medication : should only be prescribed by a medical professional for severe or  persistent cases.
---
Helpful Strategies to Promote Positive Behavior   
---
Celebrate and build strengths and successes   
Tell the child what they do well and what you like. A sense of competence fosters  motivation. Use positive feedback more often than corrections.   
Example:  “Great job putting your dishes in the sink!”   
---
Respect and listen   
Pay attention to both verbal and non -verbal communication.   
Example:  “You keep sitting on that side. Is the sun in your eyes over here?”   
---
Validate concerns and emotions   
Acknowledge fears or discomfort. 
Help label emotions.   
Examples:   
• “I know you don’t like spiders. I can see that you’re afraid.”  
 
• “I can see that you’re angry our plans have changed.”   
Provide clear expectations of behavior   
Use visual aids, photos, or video models. A helpful strategy is “Tell -Show-Do.”   
---
Set them up for success   
Offer accommodations (e.g., one -word answers, Velcro shoes). Modify the environment for better outcomes.   
Ignore challenging behavior (strategically)   
Avoid reinforcing negative behavior. Be consistent, and pair this approach with positive reinforcement.   
Example: Do not give a lollipop to stop a tantrum.   
---
Alternate tasks   
Balance difficult tasks with enjoyable or easier ones to prevent frustration.   
---
Teach at their learning level   
Avoid tasks that are too easy or too hard. Focus on growth and realistic goals.   
---
Give choices within limits   
Allow some control while keeping structure.   
Example:  “Do you want to eat first, or paint first?”   
---
Provide access to breaks   
Teach how to request breaks (e.g., PECS card) and always honor valid requests.   
---
Promote calm -down spaces   
Create a safe space the child can use voluntarily —not as punishment.   
---
Use reinforcement systems   
Reward desired behavior with praise or preferred items.   
Example:  “You stayed with me while shopping. You’ve earned a ride on the toy airplane!”   
---
Allow personal time   
Let them engage in preferred or self -soothing behaviors (“stimming”) when appropriate.   
---
Reward flexibility and self -control   
Example:  “The pool was closed but you stayed calm —let’s go get ice cream!”   
---
Pick your battles   
Focus on the most essential behaviors. Balance discipline with enjoyment and positivity.   
---
Use positive/proactive language   
Say what you want them to do rather than what not to do.   
Example:  Instead of “Stop picking your nose,” say “Use a tissue.”
