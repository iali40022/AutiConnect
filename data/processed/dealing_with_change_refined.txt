Dealing with Change: Key Strategies for Autistic Individuals   

Routines and Difficulties with Change   

Autistic people can find any kind of change difficult, whether it’s small day -to-day  transitions or major life events. Set routines, rituals, and predictability can help manage  anxiety and create a sense of safety. For example:   

• Always travelling the same route to school or work  
 
• Eating the same food for breakfast  
 
• Having precise rituals around daily activities   

Rules and routines  can become especially rigid during periods of stress, illness, or major  change. Even minor transitions , such as moving between two activities, can cause  distress.   

Common Signs Related to Routine Dependence  
 
• Distress with changes to the environment, people, or schedules  
 
• Strong preferences for specific items (e.g., clothing fabric, soap brand)  
 
• Verbal rituals (repeated questioning with specific expected answers)  
 
• Compulsive behaviours (e.g., frequent handwashing or checking locks)   

Note: Compulsive behaviours do not always indicate OCD, but if concerned, consult a GP.     

Strategies to Support with Change   

1. Find Out About the Change   

Be proactive as a parent or carer. If a change is upcoming (e.g., a teacher leaving school),  try to get as much detail as possible in advance so the autistic individual can prepare.   

2. Describe the Change Clearly  
 
• Mark the date of the change on a calendar and help count down the days  
 
• Use clear, simple language  
 
• Limit gestures and facial expressions while explaining   

3. Use Visual Supports   

Visual aids can improve understanding and reduce anxiety:  
 
• Show photos of the new place , new people , or new activities  
 
• Create a photo book or folder to look at before and during the change  
 
• If going on holiday, show pictures of the entire journey , not just the airplane   

On the day of the change:  
 
• Use a visual timetable  to show what’s happening and when  
 
• Reverse the visuals to help explain the return journey   

4. Involve the Right People   

If moving to a new school or care provider:  
 
• Involve staff from both the current and new settings  
 
• Ensure person-centred planning  
 
• Focus on the individual’s needs, communication preferences, and potential anxiety  triggers   

5. Support Transitions Between Activities   

Sequencing and understanding time can be difficult. Strategies include:  
 
• Use a visual “now -and-next” board  
 
• Use a timer to show when an activity will end  
 
• Allow the person to move symbols or objects  to indicate an activity is finished  
 
• Make wait times as short and predictable as possible  
 
• Use visual representations of waiting time  (timers, sticker clocks)  
 
• Introduce transition boxes  with calming activities   

6. Manage Anxiety  
 
• Be observant of anxiety signs  
 
• Offer a worry book  or worry box  to express concerns  
 
• Explain positive aspects  of the change  
 
• Use social stories  or apps like “Brain in Hand” for support
