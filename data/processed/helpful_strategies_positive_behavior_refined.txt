Helpful Strategies to Promote Positive Behavior   

Celebrate and build strengths and successes   
Tell the child what they do well and what you like. A sense of competence fosters  motivation. Use positive feedback more often than corrections.   
Example:  “Great job putting your dishes in the sink!”   

Respect and listen   
Pay attention to both verbal and non -verbal communication.   
Example:  “You keep sitting on that side. Is the sun in your eyes over here?”   

Validate concerns and emotions   
Acknowledge fears or discomfort. 
Help label emotions.   
Examples:   
• “I know you don’t like spiders. I can see that you’re afraid.”  
 
• “I can see that you’re angry our plans have changed.”   
Provide clear expectations of behavior   
Use visual aids, photos, or video models. A helpful strategy is “Tell -Show-Do.”   

Set them up for success   
Offer accommodations (e.g., one -word answers, Velcro shoes). Modify the environment for better outcomes.   
Ignore challenging behavior (strategically)   
Avoid reinforcing negative behavior. Be consistent, and pair this approach with positive reinforcement.   
Example: Do not give a lollipop to stop a tantrum.   

Alternate tasks   
Balance difficult tasks with enjoyable or easier ones to prevent frustration.   

Teach at their learning level   
Avoid tasks that are too easy or too hard. Focus on growth and realistic goals.   

Give choices within limits   
Allow some control while keeping structure.   
Example:  “Do you want to eat first, or paint first?”   

Provide access to breaks   
Teach how to request breaks (e.g., PECS card) and always honor valid requests.   

Promote calm -down spaces   
Create a safe space the child can use voluntarily —not as punishment.   

Use reinforcement systems   
Reward desired behavior with praise or preferred items.   
Example:  “You stayed with me while shopping. You’ve earned a ride on the toy airplane!”   

Allow personal time   
Let them engage in preferred or self -soothing behaviors (“stimming”) when appropriate.   

Reward flexibility and self -control   
Example:  “The pool was closed but you stayed calm —let’s go get ice cream!”   

Pick your battles   
Focus on the most essential behaviors. Balance discipline with enjoyment and positivity.   

Use positive/proactive language   
Say what you want them to do rather than what not to do.   
Example:  Instead of “Stop picking your nose,” say “Use a tissue.”
