Language Development in Autistic Children   

Key Points   

• Autistic children might need support to develop language skills.  
 
• Providing opportunities to use language can enhance their development.  
 
• Playing, modeling language, and responding positively to language can improve  communication.   

How Autistic Children Develop Language  
 
• Children develop language through relationships and play.  
 
• Autistic children may struggle with language development because they focus on  details in their environment, missing key language -learning opportunities.  
 
• For example, a baby distracted by a ceiling fan may not engage in social interactions  necessary for language learning.   

Creating Opportunities for Language Use  
 
• Autistic children need regular, meaningful, and motivating  opportunities to use  language.  
 
• Strategies to encourage language use:   o Place their favorite toy out of reach so they need to ask for it.   o Take turns during activities (e.g., opening picture books, playing with puzzles).   o Pause and give them time to express thoughts or feelings.   

Progressing Language Skills  
 
• Gradually increase language complexity:   o Start with single -word responses (e.g., "Ball").   o Move to short phrases (e.g., "Push the ball").   o Introduce social greetings (e.g., waving, saying "Hi").   o Transfer these skills to different people and settings.   

Using Play to Support Language Development  
 
• Play helps children learn language in a natural way.  
 
• Examples:   o If doing a jigsaw puzzle, only hand them a piece when they ask for it.   o Engage in pretend play where they communicate needs or make requests.   

Modeling Language for Autistic Children  
 
• Modeling  involves demonstrating how to use language with words, facial expressions,  and gestures.  
 
• Strategies:   o Comment on actions: Say "Open" while opening a door.   o Label experiences: Say "Stuck" when they struggle with a zipper.   o Provide words they may need: Say "Help" when they try to open a packet.   

Encouraging Speech & Language Growth  
 
• Follow the child's interests : Engage in conversations about topics they enjoy.  
 
• Adapt communication : If they use 1 -word phrases, model 2-3 word sentences to  expand their language skills.  
 
• Respond positively : Reward communication efforts by giving them what they request or  by smiling and engaging.   

When to Seek Professional Help  
 
• If concerned about a child’s language development, consult:   o Child and family health nurses   o General practitioners (GPs)   o Pediatricians   o Speech pathologists   

Alternative Communication Methods  
 
• Some autistic children use gestures, Key Word Sign, PECS (Picture Exchange  Communication System), or other augmentative communication methods. 
 
• You can support language development by building on their preferred communication  style.   o Example: If a child pulls your hand toward an object, model how they can use  words to ask for it.
