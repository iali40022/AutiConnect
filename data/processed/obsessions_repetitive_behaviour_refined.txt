Obsessions and Repetitive Behaviour   

Intense Interests   
• Intense, highly focused interests are common in autistic individuals and can start  at a young age.  
 
• These interests may involve topics like art, music, gardening, animals, numbers, or  fictional characters.  
 
• People may also form attachments to objects or enjoy collecting things.  
 
• Intense interests can contribute to well -being, relaxation, and may lead to  meaningful activities like work or study.   

When Interests Become Obsessions   
Ask yourself:  
 
• Is the person unable to stop the activity/interest independently?  
 
• Is the interest impacting learning?  
 
• Is it limiting social opportunities?  
 
• Is it causing disruption to others?   
The intensity and duration of interest distinguish an obsession from a hobby.     

Repetitive Behaviour ("Stimming")  
 
• Includes: hand -flapping, finger -flicking, rocking, spinning, jumping, or complex  movements.  
 
• Functions of repetitive behaviours:   
o Provide structure and predictability.   
o Help manage anxiety, stress, or uncertainty.   
o Offer sensory stimulation (e.g., balance, visuals, sound).   
o Help in social interaction and relaxation.     

Strategies for Managing Obsessions and Repetitive Behaviour  

1. Understand the Function  
• Ask: What purpose does this behaviour serve?   
o Reducing anxiety or noise.   
o Seeking sensory input.   
o Coping with stress.   

2. Modify the Environment  
• Is the environment too noisy or bright (e.g., strip lights)?  
 
• Change the surroundings to reduce sensory overload.  
 
• Offer alternatives to achieve similar stimulation.   

3. Increase Structure  
• Create predictability using:   
o Visual supports (e.g., daily timetables).   
o Social stories.   
o Time tools (e.g., timers, time -tables).  
 
• Plan in advance for transitions and stressful events.  
 
• Reduce boredom by preparing calming or enjoyable activities.   

4. Manage Anxiety  
• Teach self -regulation strategies:   
o Deep breathing.   
o Stress balls.   
o Visual emotion scales (e.g., traffic lights, thermometer).  
 
• Use concrete visuals to explain emotions.  
 
• Consider apps or digital tools for self -management.  
 
• Seek support from autism -aware counsellors.   

5. Intervene Early  
• Behaviours are harder to change over time.  
 
• Start early with gentle redirection.  
 
• Example: Stroking hair may be okay for a child, but not appropriate as they age.   

6. Set Boundaries  
• Introduce limits on:   
o Time spent on interest.   
o Places where behaviours occur.  
 
• Gradually reduce time/frequency:   
o Week 1: Talk about a topic for 15 mins per hour.   
o Week 2: 10 mins per hour.   
o Week 3: 10 mins every two hours.   

7. Provide Alternatives  
• Suggest related activities:   
o Writing in an interest journal.   
o Recording voice notes.  
 
• Explore joining clubs, volunteering, or work related to the interest.  
 
• Replace sensory behaviours with safer alternatives:   
o Smearing → use playdough.   
o Mouthing inedible items → offer crunchy food or chewables.
