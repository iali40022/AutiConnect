What is Self -Injurious Behaviour?   

Self-injurious behaviour refers to physically harming oneself, also called self-harm.  
Examples include:   
• Head banging  
 
• Hand or arm biting  
 
• Hair pulling  
 
• Eye gouging  
 
• Face or head slapping  
 
• Skin picking, scratching, or pinching

About half of autistic people experience self-injurious behaviour at some point.     

Causes of Self -Injurious Behaviour   

Communication difficulties:  
 
• The person may use self -injury to express frustration, seek desired  objects/activities, or avoid tasks.  
 
• Examples: head slapping to express pain, hand biting for anxiety, skin picking due to boredom.   

Mental health issues:  
 
• May indicate depression or anxiety.   

Repetitive behaviours:  
 
• Could stem from obsession or routine.   

Developmental stage -related:  
 
• Behaviours such as hand mouthing may persist.   

Learned behaviours:  
 
• Self-injury may become a learned way to control the environment or avoid unwanted situations.     

What to Do During an Episode  
 
• Respond quickly and consistently , never ignore severe behaviour.  
 
• Keep responses low-key: calm voice, limited facial expressions.  
 
• Reduce demands : postpone difficult tasks.  
 
• Remove physical/sensory discomforts : adjust clothing, noise levels, lighting, etc.  
 
• Redirect : use clear verbal instructions and visual cues. Offer alternative activities.  
 
• Light physical guidance : gently redirect hands, but use caution to avoid escalation.  
 
• Use barriers : e.g. pillows for head banging, alternative objects for biting.  
 
• Physical restraints  (only under specialist guidance): helmets, gloves, etc. Must be  temporary and combined with skill development.     

Preventing Self -Injurious Behaviour  
 
• Seek medical or dental advice : rule out physical causes.  
 
• Use a behaviour diary : track events before/during/after episodes to find patterns.  
 
• Increase structure and routine : create predictable daily plans.  
 
• Provide sensory alternatives : e.g. trampolines, chewable objects.  
 
• Use communication tools : e.g. visual symbols, body part pictures.  
 
• Reward appropriate behaviour : use praise, activities, or tokens immediately after  positive behaviour.  
 
• Medication : should only be prescribed by a medical professional for severe or  persistent cases.
