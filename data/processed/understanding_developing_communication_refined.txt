Understanding Autistic Communication   

• Autistic people may have difficulties with both verbal and non -verbal communication.  
 
• They might not respond to their name, use echolalia (repeating words/phrases), or  communicate through behaviours instead of words.     

Stages of Communication (Hanen Programme)   

1. Own Agenda  – Prefers playing alone, communication is mostly unintentional.   

2. Requester  – Begins to understand that actions can influence others; may pull adults to  items.   

3. Early Communicator  – Engages in more two -way interaction using gestures, sounds, or  echolalia.   

4. Partner – Uses speech to communicate and engage in conversation but may find  unfamiliar environments challenging.     

Strategies to Support Communication   

Follow Their Lead  
 
• Let the child guide the interaction. 

Join their activity rather than directing it.   

Use Early Interaction Techniques  
 
• Use single words  for children at earlier communication stages (e.g., say “car” while  handing them a toy car).  
 
• Use expansions  to build on their communication, like turning “car” into “red car”.   

Build Communication Opportunities  
 
• Avoid anticipating all their needs.  
 
• Wait and encourage them to signal or ask for help. Offer support only after giving them  the chance to initiate.   

Be Face-to-Face  
 
• Position yourself at the child’s level to share eye contact and focus.   

Imitate  
 
• Copy their actions (e.g., spinning, clapping) to build a connection and promote  interaction.   

Use Gestures and Visual Aids  
 
• Demonstrate actions when speaking.  
 
• Use objects, photographs, cue cards, and visual timetables to reinforce meaning.   

Use Songs and Roleplay  
 
• Sing familiar songs and pause at predictable points to encourage participation.  
 
• Roleplay common scenarios using toys to build understanding and vocabulary.   

Give Feedback  
 
• Praise efforts to communicate and add comments to show you understand and  encourage further interaction.     

Creating Reasons to Communicate  
 
• Place favourite items slightly out of reach to motivate requests.  
 
• Use containers that require assistance to open.  
 
• Include unexpected situations (e.g., giving an empty cup) to prompt clarification.  
 
• Respect when the child ends an activity, even if it’s not verbally expressed.     

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)   

AAC includes methods to support or replace spoken language.  
 
• Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS)  
 
• Sign Language  (e.g., Makaton, BSL)  
 
• Communication books or cue cards  
 
• Voice output devices  (e.g., BIGmack buttons)   

Note: Facilitated Communication is not recommended  due to lack of scientific evidence and  the risk of misleading input.     

Communication in Educational Settings  
 
• Children may struggle more to communicate in school due to anxiety, sensory issues, or  social stress.  
 
• Provide structure, patience, and repeated opportunities to practice communication.  
 
• Understand that speaking fluently does not always mean a child fully understands  instructions.
