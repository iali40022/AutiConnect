Visual Supports   

Types of Visual Support 

Visual supports are a communication tool that can be used with autistic people. They can be used in most situations, are adaptable, and portable. 

Visual supports can help to:   
• Provide structure and routine  
 
• Encourage independence  
 
• Build confidence  
 
• Improve understanding  
 
• Avoid frustration and anxiety  
 
• Provide opportunities to interact with others   

A wide range of items can be used as visual supports, including:  
 
• Real objects, printed images, or digital tools (smartphones, tablets, computers)  
 
• Tactile symbols (e.g., swimming trunks, packaging, food labels)  
 
• Photographs  
 
• Short videos  
 
• Miniatures of real objects  
 
• Colored pictures  
 
• Plain squares of colored card  
 
• Line drawings  
 
• Symbols  
 
• Written words   

Uses of Visual Supports   

Visual supports can be used in different ways, such as:  
 
• Single message : The person takes a yellow card when they need to go to the toilet or  places a purple card on a board when feeling stressed.  
 
• Daily schedule : Visual timetables, reward charts, and structured routines help provide  predictability.  
 
• Making choices : The person selects a visual option, such as placing the trampolining  symbol in the "afternoon" slot on the board.  
 
• Illustrating a story : Used in social stories and comic strip conversations.  
 
• Expressing opinions : Using a thumbs -up/down symbol to indicate enjoyment of an  activity.   

Examples of Visual Supports  
 
• Choice boards  
 
• Different colored tablecloths (e.g., white for dinner time, blue for coloring time)  
 
• Emotion thermometers  
 
• First-then sequences  
 
• Key phrase symbols (e.g., "I want," "What’s that?")  
 
• Labels for objects and storage  
 
• Morning schedules  
 
• Photos and maps for explanations (e.g., "Mom is at work," "My new school is in  Glasgow")  
 
• Safety signs  
 
• Visual scripts for social situations  
 
• Task sequence instruction strips (e.g., for using the bathroom)  
 
• Time trackers for transitions between activities   

Top Tips for Using Visual Supports  
 
• Portable : Use apps, store images on a phone, or carry laminated symbols in a folder.  
 
• Durable: Laminate printed materials and back up digital files.  
 
• Easy to find : Place symbols in visible locations, attach to objects, or keep them in a  designated folder.  
 
• Personalized : Adapt to individual preferences (e.g., using a space -themed visual  timetable for a child interested in rockets).  
 
• Consistent : Use the same type of symbols (e.g., line drawings vs. photographs) across  different settings and ensure caregivers use them consistently.
